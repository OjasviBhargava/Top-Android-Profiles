2. *Jon Skeet's addition operator doesn't commute; it teleports to where he needs it to be*
3. *Jon Skeet doesn't have performance bottlenecks. He just makes the universe wait its turn*

5. *Jon Skeet coded his last project entirely in Microsoft Paint, just for the challenge.*
6. *Jon Skeet can recite π. Backwards.*
7. *If Jon Skeet posts a duplicate question on StackOverflow, the original question will be closed as a duplicate.*

When it comes to Android Open Source Projects my personal favorite is Jake. He currently works for Google and before that worked for Square. Many of you might not have used third party libraries, though some of his best libraries still used are :
<ul>
  <li> *Butterknife* </li>
  <li> *Retrofit* </li>
  <li> *okhttp* </li>
  <li> *RxAndroid* </li>
  <li> *android-ktx* </li>
